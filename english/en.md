This is an overview of the equipment and facilities DD Lab and Audio design have to offer.

Choose one of the categories above to see the overview of the relevant facilities and equipment.

It is stated for each facility or piece of equipment whether it can be lent out and thus brought out of DD Lab.

DD Lab employees have created guides for several of our facilities. Please note that several of the facilities require that you apply for a driving license for the facility in question or participate in an introductory workshop to obtain permission to use the facility. This will be clear from the overview.

DD Lab is funded by the teaching aids from the department of Communication and Culture (IKK) at Aarhus University. DD Lab is therefore primarily a teaching facility and the main purpose of DD Lab is to support projects, activities and teaching regarding physical interaction for students. However, researchers and others associated with the department also have access to the lab's facilities. [Read more about DD Lab here.](https://ddlab.au.dk/)
